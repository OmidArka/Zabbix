Install Zabbix on Debian 12

In this tutorial, we will show you how to install Zabbix on Debian 12. Monitoring and managing IT infrastructure is crucial for businesses and organizations to ensure seamless operations and optimal performance. Zabbix, an open-source monitoring solution, offers a powerful platform to monitor various components of your infrastructure.

This article assumes you have at least basic knowledge of Linux, know how to use the shell, and most importantly, you host your site on your own VPS. The installation is quite simple and assumes you are running in the root account, if not you may need to add ‘sudo‘ to the commands to get root privileges. I will show you the step-by-step installation of Zabbix on a Debian 12 (Bookworm).


Prerequisites

A server running one of the following operating systems: Debian 12 (Bookworm).
It’s recommended that you use a fresh OS install to prevent any potential issues.
SSH access to the server (or just open Terminal if you’re on a desktop).
An active internet connection. You’ll need an internet connection to download the necessary packages and dependencies for Zabbix.
A non-root sudo user or access to the root user. We recommend acting as a non-root sudo user, however, as you can harm your system if you’re not careful when acting as the root.
Install Zabbix on Debian 12 Bookworm
Step 1. Before we install any software, it’s important to make sure your system is up to date by running the following apt commands in the terminal:

1-sudo apt update
2-sudo apt install build-essential libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev
This command will refresh the repository, allowing you to install the latest versions of software packages.

Step 2. Installing Zabbix on Debian 12.

To access the latest Zabbix packages, we need to add the official repository. Run these commands:

3-wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/6.5/debian/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_6.5-1+debian12_all.deb
4-sudo dpkg -i zabbix-release_6.5-1+debian12_all.deb
5-sudo apt update
Now it’s time to install the Zabbix server on your Debian 12 system:

Install PostgreSQL
To set up a new PostgreSQL database server on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, then use these commands.


****sudo apt update
****sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
*****sudo service postgresql start
Check the status.
sudo service postgresql status
sudo apt install zabbix-server-pgsql zabbix-frontend-php zabbix-apache-conf zabbix-agent
Step 3. Configuring Zabbix Server.

Next, let’s configure the Zabbix server to ensure smooth operation. Create a PostgreSQL database and user for Zabbix:

6-sudo su - postgres
7-createuser --pwprompt zabbix
8-createdb -O zabbix zabbix

*** psql
Add the user.


CREATE USER zbx_monitor WITH PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>' INHERIT;
GRANT pg_monitor TO zbx_monitor;
Confirm user exists


select * from pg_catalog.pg_user;
Exit back to the bash prompt.


\q
***mkdir /var/lib/zabbix
exit

9-vim.tiny /etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf

9- DBPassword=password
Edit the Zabbix PHP configuration file:

9- sudo vim.tiny /etc/zabbix/apache.conf
Uncomment and modify the following lines:

php_value date.timezone America/New_York
Save the file and exit the editor.

Next, Edit the PHP configuration file:

10- sudo vim.tiny /etc/zabbix/php-fpm.conf
Change the following values:

php_value[date.timezone] = America/New_York
Step 4. Installing Zabbix Agent.

The Zabbix agent is responsible for collecting data from the monitored host and sending it to the Zabbix server. Let’s proceed with the installation and configuration.


Now, let’s configure the Zabbix agent to communicate with the server:

Zabbix Server Connection
11-sudo nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
Set the Zabbix server IP or hostname:

*Server=zabbix
*ServerActive=zabbix
*Hostname= postgres
Save the file and exit the editor.

12- systemctl status zabbix-server zabbix-agent postgresql apache2

Host Configuration
On the Zabbix server, add the monitored host by following these steps:

Log in to the Zabbix web interface (http://your-server-ip/zabbix).
Navigate to “Configuration” > “Hosts” > “Create host.”
Enter the necessary details, such as hostname, IP address, and select the group.
user & Pass Default :
